Dear Hiring Team at Acme Bank,

I am excited to apply for the Lead Software Engineer position within the banking platform team.
With my extensive experience in the tech industry
and hands-on expertise in designing scalable, secure systems,
I am eager to contribute to the development of your next-generation core banking platform.

At Start From Today, I launched a talent platform with 20K+ monthly active users.
My role involved leading a cross-functional team of 10+ engineers, championing CI/CD practices,
architecting a scalable microservices-based system (60+ services),
contributing as a developer, and managing GCP infrastructure (250+ containers).
Throughout this project, I effectively coordinated team efforts
and fostered a collaborative work environment, demonstrating my leadership skills.
This experience closely aligns with the responsibilities of the Lead Software Engineer position at Acme Bank.

Previously, as a Software Engineer at CQG Inc.,
I integrated 16 financial exchanges into a C++ microservices-based data feed,
achieving sub-100 microsecond latency in co-located environments.
This experience honed my expertise in low-latency systems and performance optimisation
--- skills that could prove valuable in developing high-performance banking software.

Your focus on cloud-native technologies and scalable microservices aligns perfectly with my background.
I have significant experience developing and deploying distributed systems in Google Cloud,
and my technical toolkit includes Python, Go, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines --- all integral to your goals.
My analytical thinking and attention to detail ensure that I deliver high-quality, robust solutions.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with Acme Bank's objectives.
Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,\\
Igor Mikushkin
