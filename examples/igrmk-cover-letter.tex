Dear Hiring Team at Acme Bank,

I am excited to apply for the Lead Software Engineer position
within the banking platform team.
With my extensive experience in the tech industry
and hands-on expertise in designing scalable, secure systems,
I am eager to contribute to the development
of your next-generation core banking platform.

At Start From Today, I led the development of a talent platform (20K+ MAU).
My role involved leading a cross-functional team of 10+ engineers,
championing CI/CD practices,
architecting a scalable microservices-based system (60+ services),
contributing as a hands-on developer,
and managing GCP infrastructure (250+ containers).

Throughout this project, I effectively coordinated team efforts
and fostered a collaborative work environment.
This experience aligns closely with the responsibilities
of the Lead Software Engineer position at Acme Bank,
particularly in terms of system architecture, and team leadership.

Previously, as a Software Engineer at CQG Inc.,
I developed C++ microservices to integrate financial exchanges into our data feed,
achieving sub-100 microsecond latency in co-located environments.
This experience enhanced my expertise
in low-latency systems and performance optimisation
--- skills that could prove valuable in developing high-performance banking software.

Your focus on cloud-native technologies
and scalable microservices aligns perfectly with my background.
I have significant experience developing
and deploying distributed systems in Google Cloud,
and my technical toolkit includes Python, Go, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines
--- all integral to your goals.

Python has been a cornerstone of my programming repertoire since 2008
when I used it to develop a tool for gathering depth of market data from feeds.
This experience highlighted the power of automated tools over manual processes
and demonstrated how they seamlessly integrate into the engineering approach.
Even when Python isn't the main language of a project,
I always use it to create auxiliary tools.

Since 2017, I have been actively engaged in personal projects using Go.
I appreciate this language for its simplicity, consistently clear code,
and excellent suitability for containerisation.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience
aligns with Acme Bank's objectives.
Thank you for considering my application.
