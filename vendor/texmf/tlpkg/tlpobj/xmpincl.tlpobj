shortdesc Include eXtensible Metadata Platform data in pdfLaTeX
longdesc The XMP (eXtensible Metadata platform) is a framework to add
longdesc metadata to digital material to enhance the workflow in
longdesc publication. The essence is that the metadata is stored in an
longdesc XML file, and this XML stream is then embedded in the file to
longdesc which it applies. How you create this XML file is up to you,
longdesc but the author started investigating this because he wanted to
longdesc embed licensing information in the files he created. The
longdesc license the author chose is one of the Creative Commons
longdesc licenses, and their web-site offers this information in a valid
longdesc XML-file, suitable for direct inclusion.
